      <p>
        To get started coding, visit our Github profile <a href=https://github.com/charitas/charitas>here</a>. This project uses React, Node and currently we are using Firebase for the backend. But we will be soon moving away from this to a micro-server to avoid disruptions of anykind.
      </p>
      <h3 style="margin-top:40px;">Can't Program?</h3>

      <p>Charitas was first started by Kyle Bradford. Kyle wanted to make software that could impact the world for the greater good. Kyle first started this project because he wanted to be able to keep track of a library of documents, videos and audio, and he wanted to be able to make it open with anyone. Kyle wants individuals to be able to translate documents, videos and audio into any language. He wants open communication so that users can understand the person they are learning from, and so that individuals can learn from their users as well.</p>
      <p>As Kyle started this project, there was too much that he wanted to add to it. And so, he realized that the projects end goal was to be open to it's users, so he decided he would make it open to everyone. Kyle wants anyone to be able to contribute if they wish.</p>
